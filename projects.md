Basic
-Maximum helicity density "swirl" from a 3d pipe with constant, laminar fluid flow
-Catapult design for maximum range (then test for fun)

Serious
-Fan + turbine inverse design for maximum efficiency/thrust/etc
-Optimal stator/rotor geometry for electromagnetic generator
-Optimal heart + artery design?
-Nuclear powered car engine?


Unstructured ideas
-Morphogen react-diffusion gradients
-Bioelectric signal amplification network
-Upgraded lungs (o2 intake?)
-Something with advanced control theory
-Something with RF or other EE topics
- generate a powerful rail gun?
